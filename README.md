# 🎵 Music App NextJS

Welcome to **Music App NextJS** – a beautifully designed, fully responsive web application for a music academy. Built using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Acertainity UI**, this project offers a real-world development experience with interactive components and smooth transitions.

This is an ideal starter project for developers transitioning from **React.js to Next.js**, while also learning **modern frontend tooling**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is part of a hands-on learning series focused on building full-stack applications with **Next.js App Router**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. You'll also gain experience in debugging through integration with the intentionally buggy **Acertainity UI** component library.

## ✨ Features

* ✅ **Responsive Design** – Mobile-first layout with Tailwind CSS breakpoints
* 🧩 **Interactive UI** – Hover effects, scroll animations, and dynamic cards
* 🧭 **Next.js App Router** – Clean routing and layout handling using modern conventions
* 🛡️ **TypeScript Support** – Strong typing for a more reliable development workflow
* 🐞 **Buggy UI Library** – Integration with **Acertainity UI** to simulate real-world debugging
* ♻️ **Modular Code** – All components are reusable and organized for scalability
