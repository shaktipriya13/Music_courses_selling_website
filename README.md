🎵 Music App NextJS
Welcome to Music App NextJS, a beautifully designed web application for a music academy built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. This project showcases a responsive and interactive UI with smooth transitions, modern layouts, and a real-world development approach. It serves as an introductory project to help developers learn Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS while building a fully functional website for a music academy.

🚀 Project Overview
This project is a part of a Next.js learning series focused on transitioning from React.js to Next.js. It introduces core Next.js concepts like the App Router, TypeScript integration, and Tailwind CSS for styling. The website includes sections like a hero banner, course cards, testimonials, and a footer, all optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
Features

Responsive Design: Fully responsive layout with Tailwind CSS, covering all breakpoints for mobile and desktop.
Interactive UI: Includes subtle animations, hover effects, and scrollable cards for an engaging user experience.
Next.js App Router: Utilizes the modern App Router for seamless routing and page navigation.
TypeScript Support: Built with TypeScript for type safety and better development experience.
Real-World Challenges: Incorporates a buggy UI library to demonstrate debugging and problem-solving in a real-world scenario.
Structured Components: Modular components for reusability and maintainability.
